# Fabricator

The fabricator is very cool.

## LCD

I like LCDs. They are powered by crystals in liquid form. What this means is they conduct electricity and output light as they go from excited -> relaxed form. They do this really fast, unlike what you'd have with fluorence or phosphorence.

## OLED

So much better lighting.
