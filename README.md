# Quantii Fabricator

A nice fabricator using EUV technology to make chips. And synthesise all the raw materials into useful stuff like glass LEDs, aluminium chassis', plastic casing.

## Design

There are 5 stages.

First stage is the CNC stage which subtractively routes, molds and mills large chunks of materials into smaller, more complex bite size and usable chunks.

- This stage requires a lot of raw material, usually in sheet forms

Second stage is the additive stage which requires powder or plastic resin or metal resin. We synthesise things from scratch using high temperatures to melt the material and form from ground up as quickly as possible.

Third stage is the chip synthesis stage. This requires photolithographic EUV to print a photomask onto a silicon wafer. High speed centrifuges and special chemicals are also applied to form the final rectangular SoC or chip.

Fourth stage is the assembly stage. Here we utilise high precision machine arms to manipulate the transforms of each object to combine mechanically. E.g. through screws, glue, welding.

- Everything should be small enough to manipulate well. Take as many sub components as needed to assemble the final product in a much larger chamber

Fifth stage is the polish stage. The final product should all be in one piece but kind of dirty from the residue from the preceding stages. High speed fans, washers, brushes and incubators are used to remove a lot of residue. The finishing touches are applied with aluminium polish. Any external stuff like screen covers and case covers are also applied here.
